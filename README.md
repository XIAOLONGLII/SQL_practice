# SQL_practice

This is the SQL practice to let me understand how this works in a very efficient way! 


Day 1, May 10:

1. Creating a table and insert data into it.

2. Select all the movies.

3. Add a second query after the first, that retrieves only the movies that were released in the year 2000 or later, not before. Sort the results so that the earlier movies are listed first.

4. Select the SUM of minutes it will take to do all of the items on your TODO list.

2. 
a, Add another SELECT that uses OR to show the titles of the songs that have an 'epic' mood or a release date after 1990.
b, Add another SELECT that uses AND to show the titles of songs that are 'epic', and released after 1990, and less than 4 minutes long.
